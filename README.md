# htmlchocolate
a webpage made in html.

if you want to translate this to another language (or slang)
open the html file in a notepad (Windows Notepad, Notepad++, etc)
and translate the words in the title, heading (h1), and paragraph. (p)
then add the file to the github page.

thank you for cooperating!
